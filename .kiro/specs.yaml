# KiroCore - Specs Configuration
# This file defines how specs are used in the KiroCore project

project:
  name: KiroCore
  description: Universal AI agent app foundation - one skeleton, endless AI apps
  tagline: "One skeleton, endless AI apps"

specs_usage:
  purpose: |
    Specs in KiroCore are used to plan and implement new features systematically.
    Each spec follows a structured workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation

  when_to_create:
    - Adding new agent app types (e.g., StudyBuddy, IdeaForge)
    - Building new core components (e.g., chat interface, agent config loader)
    - Implementing backend API routes
    - Adding new UI features or pages

  workflow:
    1_requirements: |
      Define user stories and acceptance criteria using EARS format
      Example: "As a developer, I want to create a new AI app by adding a config file"

    2_design: |
      Create technical design with architecture, components, and data models
      Include API endpoints, component hierarchy, and data flow diagrams

    3_tasks: |
      Break down implementation into actionable coding tasks
      Each task should be specific and reference requirements

    4_implementation: |
      Execute tasks one by one using Kiro's task execution feature
      Mark tasks complete as you finish them

      priority: low

best_practices:
  - Start with clear requirements before coding
  - Use specs for complex features (3+ components or files)
  - Keep tasks small and focused (1-2 hours max)
  - Reference requirements in task descriptions
  - Update spec status as you progress
  - Use specs to document architectural decisions

examples:
  creating_new_spec: |
    1. Create folder: .kiro/specs/my-feature/
    2. Add requirements.md with user stories
    3. Add design.md with technical approach
    4. Add tasks.md with implementation checklist
    5. Execute tasks using Kiro's task runner

  spec_structure: |
    .kiro/specs/feature-name/
    ├── requirements.md  # User stories & acceptance criteria
    ├── design.md        # Architecture & technical design
    └── tasks.md         # Implementation task list
